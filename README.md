# Python-Login-System
Python Login System V1
This project is a simple command-line-based login system implemented in Python. It allows users to create an account and securely log in using a username and password.

Features:
Account Creation: Users can create an account by entering a unique username and a password. The password is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm before being stored.
Secure Login: Users can log in by providing their username and password. The system checks if the hashed version of the entered password matches the stored hash.
Error Handling: The system provides feedback on incorrect passwords or non-existent accounts.
Getting Started

Notes:
